Abstract
Anomalies of a quantum field theory (QFT) constitute fundamental non-perturbatively
robust data. In this paper we extract anomalies of 5D superconformal field theories (SCFTs)
directly from the underlying extra-dimensional geometry. We show that all of this informa-
tion can be efficiently extracted from extra-dimensional η-invariants, bypassing previously es-
tablished approaches based on computationally cumbersome blowup / resolution techniques.
We illustrate these considerations for 5D SCFTs engineered in M-theory by non-compact ge-
ometries X = C3/Γ with finite subgroup Γ ⊂SU(3), where the anomalies are determined
by the η-invariants of the asymptotic boundary ∂X = S5/Γ. Our results apply equally to
Abelian and non-Abelian Γ, as well as isolated and non-isolated singularities. In the setting
of non-isolated singularities we further analyze the interplay of anomaly structures across
different strata of the singular locus.
Our considerations extend readily to backgrounds
which are not global orbifolds, as well as those which do not preserve supersymmetry.

Introduction
In recent years generalized symmetries of quantum field theories (QFTs) have seen increased
study via their symmetry theories.1 Symmetry theories, including, e.g., symmetry topologi-
cal field theories (SymTFTs), are auxiliary extra-dimensional theories isolating and organiz-
ing structures governing a QFTs symmetries across its global forms.
Such auxiliary theories are strikingly physical in contexts where the QFT is itself re-
alized via an extra-dimensional construction, as is the case for string constructed QFTs,
supersymmetric or not, and QFTs with gravitational duals.2 The main idea is that the QFT
of interest sits in a local patch of an extra-dimensional geometry which can then be studied
in isolation after decoupling all bulk degrees of freedom.
To illustrate, consider string / M-theory backgrounds of the form Md × X with M flat
Minkowski space and non-compact X a topological cone Cone(∂X) with a singularity at the
tip. This engineers a theory TX where the QFT degrees of freedom remain localized at the
tip of the cone, and other non-dynamical structures can be associated with singularities and
branes which extend from the tip of the cone to asymptotic infinity, i.e., ∂X. An important
feature of this approach is that it provides a general way to engineer theories which are
intrinsically strongly coupled, including, for example 6D and 5D SCFTs.3 In addition to
purely geometric backgrounds, one can also include additional gravitational sources to realize
many examples of the AdS / CFT correspondence, where the spacetime geometry is then of
the form AdSd+1 × ∂X.
The SymTFT framework naturally arise in this setting since the cone automatically comes
with two “boundaries.” One is the locus of the interacting QFTd itself, while the other is the
boundary ∂X at asymptotic infinity. Schematically, one can realize a (d + 1)-dimensional
bulk which encodes the symmetry data of the QFTd by reducing along the link geometry
∂X, resulting in the schematic relation:
“∂X 7→SymTFT(TX).”
(1.1)
This class of TFTs includes quadratic order BF-terms, as follows directly from a computation
of the associated higher-form symmetries of the QFTd, which can in turn be extracted from
the defect group [42] as in [43,44].4 In [14] it was also proposed that (at least in principle)
one can use the reduction of the M-theory topological terms C3 ∧G4 ∧G4 and C3 ∧X8(R)
to extract cubic couplings of the SymTFT.
Easier said than done.

dimensional supergravity theory around the torsion classes of X.

formulation of gauge potentials in differential cohomology, see reference [45].

In practice, there are many limitations to carrying through the mapping of line (1.1).
Singularities of X complicate the reduction and uniform approaches have been developed for
settings in which X admits a desingularization. However, favorable desingularizations may
not exist or geometric moduli spaces, such as in settings of exceptional holonomy, may lack
sufficient control. There is also the practical consideration that the resolution of the singu-
larities of X is often rather challenging and introduces a significant amount of resolution-
dependent structure into the problem.5 Even assuming this has been accomplished, one is
then faced with the question of how to compute relevant intersection / cohomology rings.
Another conceptual issue is that if the linking geometry ∂X is also singular, then one has
additional physical degrees of freedom on stratified loci. In this case, smoothing such sin-
gularities can obscure some of the desired topological couplings of the bulk system. On the
other hand, if the singularities are retained the supergravity approximation is inappropriate,
and must be supplemented by additional physical inputs.
Faced with these considerations, our aim in this work will be to develop a practical com-
putational scheme for extracting such topological data directly from the extra-dimensional
geometry, irrespective of whether X carries stratified singularity structures. The main theme
will be to eschew the use of any blowups and instead work directly with the singular geometry
X and its (possibly also singular) boundary geometry ∂X.
The main idea we develop is that the relevant anomaly data is all captured by a suitable
class of η-invariants defined on the (possibly singular) boundary geometry ∂X. On gen-
eral grounds, the reason one ought to expect such a correspondence is that relevant bulk
intersection-theoretic quantities can often be recast in terms of invariants constructed from
integration of characteristic classes. For example, the triple intersection numbers Di∩Dj∩Dk
of non-compact divisors in a non-compact threefold X can be written as:
Di ∩Dj ∩Dk ∼
Z
X
FiFjFk ,
(1.2)
where we have used the well-known correspondence between line bundles, their first Chern
classes and divisors. On the other hand, it is well-known that index theorems on non-compact
spaces receive contributions from a suitable η-invariant on ∂X. We leverage this observation
to fully dispense with the bulk, focusing instead on the structures intrinsic to the singular
geometry and its avatar ∂X. Indeed, general anomaly inflow considerations directly imply
that all of the relevant data can be extracted directly from ∂X.
The main class of theories we will consider are string / M-theory backgrounds where
X = Cn/Γ for finite Γ. In the case of ADE singularities C2/ΓADE, M-theory on this space
engineers 7D Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, and similar considerations hold for IIA on the
same geometry. M-theory on a supersymmetric background X = C3/Γ typically engineers
a 5D SCFT. We show that in this class of backgrounds, 1-form symmetry anomalies as well

as mixed 1-form 0-form symmetry anomalies are all captured by differences of suitable η-
invariants evaluated modulo 1 (i.e., in Q/Z). For the subclass of isolated singularities this will
simply follow from the Atiyah-Singer-Patodi index theorem. For non-isolated singularities,
where supergravity approximations away from the singularity break down (on which the
former case relies), we will instead demonstrate this through explicit computation.6
The relation between η-invariants and anomalies we point out has a number of advantages
over resolution based methods. First, this perspective presents anomalies purely as data of
∂X = S5/Γ and as such, we expect the presented methods to be minimal, at least in the
context of computational complexity. Second, for spaces such as S5/Γ expressions for the
relevant η-invariants are well-known, and the anomalies can be presented in closed form,
often as some rational function across families of geometries. Further, our approach applies
to both Abelian and non-Abelian groups Γ, groups preserving supersymmetry or not, and
does not require considerations of any smoothings. The latter is a drastic simplification:
instead of requiring an understanding of the moduli space of the geometry X or equivalently
the moduli space of the physical theory TX (and the relevant cohomology theories across it),
we have that the anomalies are derived directly from the singular geometry. Third, for the
case of non-isolated singularities we will be also able to study symmetry structures across
the different strata of the singular locus and their interplay [34]. Fourth, generalizations to
other geometric backgrounds are immediate. Fifth, note that there are a number of extra-
dimensional approaches to symmetry theories where reduction procedures, similar to (1.1),
are applied to (non-closed) subsets of X of codimension larger than one (with boundaries).7
In such settings working directly with these subsets is preferable in the sense of the first
point above.
To proceed then, this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review features of the
dimensional reduction scheme (1.1) and generalizations thereof. In section 3 we review some
properties of η-invariants and collect some technical background material. Section 4 discusses
the prototype example of ADE singularities C2/ΓADE in M-theory focusing on aspects which
will play key roles when considering the Calabi-Yau orbifolds C3/Γ in section 5. At the
end of section 4 we also discuss related constructions in IIA, including non-supersymmetric
orbifold backgrounds. In section 5 we further discuss the interplay of anomaly data across
strata of the singular locus, and the structures which may be reliably computed from the
effective 11D supergravity approximation. In section 6 we present our conclusions and an
outlook. Some computational details, explicitly discussed with respect to two representative
families of geometries, are presented in Appendix A.
6See Appendix A for two representative cases of such computations.
7Here, instead of presenting X as fibered over some radial interval, it is viewed with respect to a projection
to some manifold with boundaries/corners (which replaces the radial interval I). Then, one dimensionally
reduces with respect to the preimage of this projection [34] (this generalizes the SymTFT sandwich to a
higher-dimensional auxiliary structure, referred to as a cheesesteak). Already, when X is not a metric cone
with multiple isolated singularities, similar considerations may be applied to realize related generalization
known as SymTrees [27].

Top Down Approach to Symmetry Theories
We now lay out and review select aspects of extra-dimensional approaches to symmetry the-
ories, such as SymTFTs, in the context of M-theory. Our discussion will center on anomaly
terms of symmetry theories and for further well-understood discussion, which focusses more
closely on the structure of the underlying defect group [42] and the associated BF-sector, we
refer to [44,47–49,45,50,51].
Let us begin by providing some perspective and motivation. In this work we will primarily
consider M-theory on the purely geometric background M ×X. Initially we will assume that
the extra-dimensional geometry X = Cone(∂X) is a cone with an isolated singularity at its
tip. Away from the tip of the cone, where X is smooth and weakly curved, 11D supergravity
is a good approximation to the effective physics. The relative theory TX can then be viewed as
a defect theory with respect to 11D supergravity. In order for this system to be well-defined
one needs to impose some consistency conditions (see, e.g., [52]). The symmetry theory
framework then aims to present the subset of consistency conditions, formulated manifestly
with regards to TX, deriving from compatibility with topological 11D bulk structures.
This basic setup and method of studying localized degrees of freedom on extra-dimensional
patches, where certain low-energy effective descriptions break down, has many generaliza-
tions. We will be mostly concerned with generalizations to non-isolated curvature singu-
larities. Of course, extensions to other singular supergravity backgrounds, by including for
example branes, also pose interesting research directions. To proceed then, in this section,
we will first lay out standard approaches applicable to isolated curvature singularities, which
results in SymTFTs, and then discuss different perspectives for approaching non-isolated
singularities.
2.1
Extra-Dimensional Starting Point
We begin with the observation that 11D supergravity has a Lagrangian formulation. So, to
first approximation, the reduction procedure in (1.1) then produces, whenever ∂X is smooth,
a Lagrangian topological field theory with action SSymTFT simply by expanding the 11D
supergravity fields and contracting their internal supports. In our discussion of anomalies,
we will focus primarily on contributions to SSymTFT which derive from the Chern-Simons
terms of 11D supergravity.

Here the integral is over an auxiliary 12-dimensional Spin manifold Y ◦
12 ⊂Y12 with boundary,
where Y12 is such that the boundary (∂Y )11 is 11D supergravity spacetime. Further, we
denote by G4 the 4-form field strength of the 3-form gauge potential C3 (i.e., locally G4 =
dC3) and Pontryagin classes by pk ≡pk(Y12).9 The space Y ◦
12 results from excising a ball
centered on the singular locus of Y12 and is such that 11D supergravity theory realizes an
accurate effective approximation precisely on (∂Y )◦

This action is considered mod 1 and Pontryagin classes therefore enter modulo congruences.
Such congruences allow for these to be expressed with respect to other characteristic classes.
We will be interested in local models for which the 11D spacetime takes the form
(∂Y )11 = R1,d−1 × X11−d ,
X11−d = Cone((∂X)10−d) ,
(2.4)
where X11−d is a metric cone with link ∂(X11−d) ≡(∂X)10−d. Consequently, Y ◦
12 is topologi-
cally modeled as
Y ◦
12 ∼R1,d−1 × I × Z11−d ,
(2.5)
where I is an open interval and Z11−d is a smooth space with boundary ∂(Z11−d) = (∂X)10−d.10
8In the second line we separated the contributions from the L-genus and ˆA-genus, associated with the
M5-brane chiral 2-form and worldvolume fermions, respectively [53–56].
9We will repeatedly encounter expressions featuring both characteristic classes pk, ck, wk, . . . and other
fields B2, C3, G4, . . . . In the latter, subscripts will make reference to the differential degree, for the former
this is generically not the case. This clash of notation is unfortunate, but standard.
10The interval I is parametrized by the radius r of the cone X11−d = Cone(∂X10−d) and explicitly given
by (r0, ∞) for some r0 > 0. The low-energy 11D supergravity approximation comes with a cutoff Λ which
determines how much curvature may be tolerated by this effective theory and therefore r0 ≡r0(Λ). In the
context of symmetry theories, which are topological, all that matters is r0 > 0 which holds for all Λ. In this
sense the picture is similar to the SymTFT sliver advocated for in holographic settings in [29]. In particular,

Figure 1: We sketch the internal dimensions of Y12 projected onto the radial coordinates of X11−d

which carries at every point, at radius r in X11−d, the fiber (∂X)10−d. This fiber collapses at r = 0
forming the singularity. At fixed radius r = r∗the radial slice of X11−d is (∂X)r=r∗
10−d. The space

11−d is smooth and has a boundary given by this copy of the link and fills it in along a transverse

11−d are topologically equivalent for
all r∗> 0. The dashed line denotes the cut used to construct Y ◦
12 via excision of a small ball
centered on the singularity. The space Y ◦
12 projects onto the shaded region.
The auxiliary space Z11−d could be realized by a copy of some desingularization of X11−d.
However, in the settings we will discuss, one can also take Z11−d to be a copy of the singular
space X11−d itself and, allowing Y ◦
12 to be singular in this sense, Y ◦
12 always exists. Our
final computations will not depend on any particular choice of Z11−d. Further, intermediate
steps will be index theoretic and readily extend to the category of orbifolds. Overall, Z11−d
always exists and using it, the Chern-Simons terms (2.3) may be formulated using singular
cohomology. In other words, the supergravity approximation suggests, focusing on anomaly
terms, that the reduction procedure (1.1) may be parsed using singular cohomology, whenever
∂X10−d is smooth, and that the corresponding SymTFT sector on R1,d−1 × I is obtained by
reduction on Z11−d starting from (2.5).11 See figure 1 for a sketch of the setup.
Above we focused on contributions to the SymTFT action from the 11D Chern-Simons
terms. Often, BF-type terms are also considered and utilized to manifestly record quantiza-
tion conditions on background fields and which background fields are quantum mechanically
conjugate variables in the SymTFT. Parsing these structures using such BF-type terms is
natural in extra-dimensional constructions of symmetry theories due to the original super-
gravity fields initially being U(1)-valued and arising outside of the context of topological
field theory. In the simplest cases, relevant BF-type terms derive from the kinetic term of
topology changing deformations to X11−d localized to its tip leave the SymTFT (and its physical boundary)
invariant until, e.g., cycles introduced by deformation exceed r0 in size, as for example studied in [27].
11Uplifts to differential cohomology, as widely considered in the literature, would allow for an intrinsically
11D formulation, but we will not require such methods in this work.

11D supergravity proportional to 1
2G4G7, see for example Appendix B of [27]. The setups
considered throughout this work may be treated similarly, in particular, these considerations
will allow us to simply read off the BF-type terms given the defect group [42–44] (which is
straightforwardly determined from the geometry as briefly reviewed in subsection 2.3).
2.2
Stratified Systems
In many situations of interest the conical geometry X includes singularities which extend
from the tip of the cone to asymptotic infinity. Moreover, these singularities can in principle
produce further intersections, leading to even further singular behavior (see, e.g., [58]). This
sort of stratification of singular structures complicates the identification of a bulk SymTFT
/ SymTh with an extra-dimensional geometry since the supergravity approximation is not
really valid near these additional singular loci.
In more detail, consider the asymptotic boundary (∂X)10−d is singular and the singu-
larity at the tip of X11−d = Cone((∂X)10−d) is non-isolated and is embedded into higher
codimension singular strata which extend radially out to the boundary. In the presence of
these additional singularities, 11D supergravity is only a good approximation on
(∂X)◦
10−d ≡(∂X)10−d \ T((∂S )D−d−1) ,
(2.6)
which is a manifold with boundary. Here SD−d denotes the full singular locus within X11−d,
which we will assume consists of a singularity enhancement at the tip of X11−d and a generic
singular stratum of dimension D−d > 0 (intersecting the boundary (∂X)10−d in (∂S )D−d−1),
and T(·) denotes an open tubular neighborhood in (∂X)10−d.
The non-compact strata of SD−d define additional QFT sectors in higher dimensions.
From this broader perspective, one can view the QFTd as an edge mode theory in a higher-
dimensional system (see, e.g., [58]). In the cases encountered in this work, we can often inter-
pret these strata as flavor branes, i.e., they admit an interpretation as a higher-dimensional
gauge theory, and so by abuse of terminology we shall always refer to such sectors as “flavor
branes” in this work. The inclusion of these flavor brane sectors in the reduction on a link-
ing geometry can schematically be viewed as contributing a BF-like theory for a continuous
non-abelian gauge theory [30].
As such, in cases with singular (∂X)10−d, there are essentially two ways to set up topo-
logical systems related to symmetries of the localized degrees of freedom. The first treats the
degrees of freedom localized to the various singular strata of SD−d uniformly, see [34]. This
procedure iterates the original SymTFT sandwich construction of [14], as previously dis-
cussed for smooth links. One introduces a second radial coordinate in (∂X)10−d centered on
(∂S )D−d−1 and repeats the discussion for smooth links now focusing on the space (∂X)10−d
8


and smooth links of the singularities modeled on
∂((∂X)◦)9−d ≡∂T((∂S )D−d−1) .
(2.7)
The construction therefore now results in two topological field theories in adjacent dimen-
sions. One derives from ∂((∂X)◦)9−d and another, which is an edge mode to it, derives from
(∂X)◦
10−d. The former is associated with (∂S )D−d−1 and captures symmetries of degrees
of freedom localized to the generic singular stratum, the latter refines these to symmetry
structures of the d-dimensional degrees of freedom localized to the singularity enhancement.
In contrast, the second topological system characterizing symmetries may only be realized
when the d-dimensional system can be isolated, i.e., when there exist limits decoupling the
non-topological excitations of the D-dimensional system. In such cases the physical boundary
condition associated in the previous construction to SD−d away from the tip of the cone
becomes non-dynamical and the second SymTFT sandwich, which opens up normal to it,
can now be contracted. The result is a standard (d + 1)-dimensional SymTFT, as with
smooth links, but now with contributions from topological structures localized to SD−d.
The first approach is set up precisely such that symmetry theories are associated with
smooth subsets of (∂X)10−d. As such, the 11D Chern-Simons term (2.3) is a good higher-
dimensional starting point for a reduction procedure formulated using singular cohomology.
Our work will be primarily motivated by this iterated SymTFT construction, which records
and relates symmetry structures across singular strata. Such book-keeping is of particu-
lar interest when symmetry structures associated with different strata interact, as, e.g., in
the setting of 2-group symmetries [59–62], and we will aim to compute anomalies of such
combined systems, sharpening observations of [34].
In contrast, working directly with the singular link, as in the second approach is less
clear, since neither the supergravity approximation may be trusted, nor the use of singular
cohomology. These challenges are quantified precisely by the first approach, which identifies
the symmetry data which can be reliably derived from the ambient supergravity theory using
singular cohomology. Of course, this still fails to access the symmetry data localized to the
singularities (∂S )D−d−1 which are truly beyond 11D supergravity and singular cohomology.12
In summary, by iterating the standard SymTFT construction across the singular strata
of the space X11−d we isolate topological structures which are reliably computable from the
bulk supergravity approximation to M-theory, utilizing a reduction scheme based on singular
cohomology. 13
12For example, in type II such data may be accessed, in part, with more stringy cohomology theories,
such as Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology [63,50], which is sensitive to twisted sectors and correctly identifies
Cartan subalgebras of flavor symmetries localized at singularities.
13Going forward we will omit indices indicating dimensions to not overcrowd notation. Similarly we leave
wedge and cup products implicit.

2.3
Defect Groups and Generalized Symmetries
Our primary focus throughout this work will center on anomalies of global symmetries and
their computations from an extra-dimensional perspective.
To frame this discussion we
collect some background material and set notation regarding the geometric and field-theoretic
characterizations of these symmetries and the defect operators which naturally carry their
representations.
In relation to the discussion so far, these should be viewed as symmetry theory substruc-
tures, e.g., counts, braidings and extension structures underlying their extended operators.
The material collected here is essentially an abridged account of developments covered in
more detail in [42,44,43,47,46,48,64,21–39,65].
Consider the theory TX engineered by X = Cone(∂X) in IIA/IIB string theory or M-
theory. We begin by introducing the defect group D (see [42]) of extended operators of
TX constructed from branes wrapping non-compact cycles in X.
Then, the generalized
symmetries of interest will be characterized by their action on D.
Let us begin with the case where ∂X is smooth, i.e., we have an isolated singularity with
no deformations. The defect group of TX is defined to be the finite abelian group [42,44,43]14

where D(n) is the subgroup of n-dimensional defects in TX that result from wrapping p-branes
on cones over classes in Tor Hp−n(∂X; Z). The natural electromagnetic pairing between p-
branes and the bilinear linking form on the torsional homology groups equip the defect group
with a Dirac pairing.
Here we assumed that integral homology accurately characterizes brane charges in the
context of defect constructions, which is, for example, accurate for the cases of X = C2/ΓADE
with finite ΓADE ⊂SU(2) and X = C3/Γ with finite Γ ⊂SU(3) in M-theory.15 In these two
setups it is well-known that

15The supersymmetric geometries here are simple enough, as checked through brane probe analysis [66,48],
that singular homology is a sufficient approximation to the homology theory characterizing configurations
of M2- and M5-branes in the context of defect constructions. Then, all further conclusions basically derive
from H1(S5/Γ; Z) ∼= Ab(Γ/Γfix) which is due to Armstrong’s theorem [67]. See also [43,44,48].

cycles which link with the 1-cycles.
When ∂X is singular (and X has non-compact singular loci), as can happen for C3/Γ,
then the geometric characterization (2.8) relates more indirectly to the defect group of TX.
For example, there are often cycles in Hk(∂X; Z) for which all representatives stretch between
the singular loci in ∂X, wrapping branes on such cycles may, by the same logic as in (2.8), be
interpreted as constructing defects for the degrees of freedom localized to the non-compact
singular loci of X. Defects of TX constructed from cones over these classes are then naturally
localized to junctions or end points to these defects of the ambient systems. These structures
can be disentangled, see [34]. For later use, we will simply record the result for X = C3/Γ
in M-theory [48]. Denoting the subgroup of Γ generated by elements with fixed points on
S5 ⊂C3 by Γfix one finds for non-isolated Calabi-Yau singularities
X = C3/Γ :
D = D(1)

(2.10)
The generalized symmetries we will be interested in are 1-form symmetries acting on the
line defects D(1)
elec. The topological operators realizing these actions may be constructed from
M5-branes wrapped over the asymptotic k-cycles which link with the 1-cycles used in the
construction of the line defects from M2-branes [64]. This 1-form symmetry group will be
denoted A and is
A ∼= (D(1)
elec)∨∼= Ab(Γ/Γfix)∨.
(2.11)
Let us spell out some further structures encountered for 5D SCFTs TX engineered by
X = C3/Γ in M-theory. Notably, by equation (2.11), the order of the 1-form symmetry group
A decreases as Γfix grows. However, notice that the quotient by Γfix leads to a collection of
non-compact ADE singularities in C3/Γ. Denoting the combined defect group of lines of this
higher dimensional system (given by 7D SYM theories) by (D(1)
elec)′ it is a geometric fact [61],
given the geometric characterization of defects in (2.8), that we have an extension of groups
1 →(D(1)
elec)′ →Ab(Γ) →D(1)
elec →1 .
(2.12)
This realizes the simplest instance in which symmetry data, here in the form of defect groups,
interplay across singular strata.16 In limits decoupling the non-topological degrees of freedom
of the higher dimensional system these structures assemble to a 2-group symmetry from the
perspective of the 5D SCFT. The non-compact singularities contribute a 5D flavor symmetry
with Lie algebra
f ≡
M
i
g(i)
ADE .
(2.13)
16Many instances of this are of course well-studied in a field-theoretic context where a defect in an ambient
QFT, supporting its own quantum system, is characterized by how bulk symmetry structures extend and
restrict onto the defect, see, e.g., the recent works [68–70].

One then has the 2-group sequence [71,59,60,72,61,62]
1 →A →eA →eF →F →1 ,
(2.14)
where eA ∼= Ab(Γ)∨, A ∼= Ab(Γ/Γfix)∨is the 1-form symmetry group, eF = ×i eG(i)
ADE is the
simply connected group with Lie algebra f, in particular, eG(i)
ADE is the simply connected ADE
group with Lie algebra g(i)
ADE, and F is the flavor symmetry group of the 5D system. See [61]

Interlude: Anomalies and η-Invariants
One of the primary goals of the present work is to develop a practical computational scheme
for extracting the anomalies of symmetries directly from the boundary geometry ∂X of a
singular conical geometry X = Cone(∂X). In this section we first motivate this correspon-
dence, and then proceed to review some more technical aspects of how this will work in
practice. In subsequent sections we deploy this formalism in a number of settings.
As mentioned in the Introduction, the main idea is that the data of anomalies is expected
to be encoded in the boundary ∂X of extra-dimensional geometry. For Calabi-Yau geometries
X with an explicit resolution e
X, one can in principle extract these anomaly coefficients by
enumerating the non-compact cycles of the geometry. Wrapping branes on such divisors and
quotienting by the states obtained from branes wrapped on compact cycles yields the defect
group, and after taking a suitable polarization one can extract the generalized symmetries of
the engineered QFTd directly from geometry. In principle, one can also extract all anomaly
data by then considering intersections between these cycles. In addition to the practical
and conceptual issues mentioned in the Introduction, there are also subtleties with reading
off the corresponding anomalies directly from intersection-theoretic data due to screening
effects. In addition, it is well-known that intersection numbers can be resolution dependent.
Faced with this situation, we shall seek a method for extracting anomalies which does not
require us to blowup the singularities at the tip of the cone X. Along these lines, we shall
now argue that η-invariants defined on ∂X provide an alternative approach which bypasses
these intersection-theoretic ambiguities and complications.
To frame the discussion to follow, recall that for a given resolution e
X, there is a corre-
spondence between line bundles and divisors. In particular, the first Chern class specifies an
element of H2( e
X; Z) which we can equally well view as specifying a cycle in Hn−2( e
X, ∂e
X; Z),
with n = dim X. Indeed, intersection numbers can instead be tracked in terms of top forms
constructed from products of Chern classes, integrated over X. For example, if X is a three-
fold, we have a triple intersection of divisors which can instead be computed with an integral
over quantized fluxes:
Di ∩Dj ∩Dk ∼
Z
X
FiFjFk ,
(3.1)
12


in the obvious notation.
Now, since X is non-compact, the divisors Di may be non-compact and the above ex-
pressions are not necessarily integral. In addition, any two non-compact divisors may differ
by compact classes, associated with dynamical excitations, such that they are, in an ap-
propriate sense, grouped into screening equivalence classes by the QFT. The invariant data
is captured by η-invariants evaluated mod 1, as will follow from the APS index theorem.
One of our tasks will be to show how this correspondence works in detail, and in particular,
to explain how we can wholly dispense with the bulk geometry X, focusing solely on ∂X
instead.
Let us emphasize once more that although equation (3.1) motivates the discussion to
follow, the intrinsic data entering our computations deals directly with a singular X and
follows purely from ∂X. In the computations to follow this is reflected in the fact that we
only need make reference to Z, namely the auxiliary space introduced so that the 11D Chern
Simons terms remain well-defined, and of which only the boundary ∂Z = ∂X is a subset of
the 11D supergravity spacetime.
We will be interested in η-invariants associated to ∂X of the Dirac operator /D and the
¯∂-operator, twisted by vector bundles. These operators are considered on Z and induce
tangential operators to the sphere quotient ∂Z. The former couples to vector bundles V ′
over Z, the latter couples only to the restriction of V ′ to ∂X, denoted V . We denote the
η-invariants by η /D
V , η
¯∂
V accordingly.
These η-invariants originate from index theoretic considerations. The two instances of the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem we will be interested in, when Z is smooth, are [73–75]

Here the bulk contributions are given by the ˆA-roof genus ˆAZ and the Todd class TdZ of
the bulk manifold Z contracted with the Chern character ch(V ′) of the bundle V ′. The

(3.3)
where λk are the eigenvalues of the induced tangential Dirac operator /D∂acting on Dirac
fermions twisted by V . Similar expressions hold for the ¯∂-operator. Further, these consid-
erations generalize to the category of orbifolds [76,77] for which the bulk integrals in (3.2)
receive additional contributions from the twisted sectors of the inertia stack of the orbifold.
13


To proceed then, and to set notation, we review the computation of η-invariants as-
sociated with twisted Dirac operators for arbitrary S2n−1/Γ with finite Γ ⊂U(n).
Our
discussion here follows Degeratu’s work [78], which extends work of B¨ar [79], and is situated
in the wider setting of orbifold index theory. In [78] the η-invariants are computed directly
from the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the Dirac operator. There, the discussion begins with
noting that S2n−1 can be realized as the quotient eU(n)/eU(n−1) where eU(n) is a double cover
of U(n) with respect to the embedding U(n) →SO(2n) and projection Spin(2n) →SO(2n).
The spin structures and therefore the Dirac operator on S2n−1 are invariant under eU(n) and
therefore much of the problem can be reduced to representation theory of eU(n). Key in these
considerations is the half-determinant representation D1/2 of eU(n) which is the square root,
with respect to the spin structure, of the determinant representation Λn(Cn) = D1/2 ⊗D1/2.
Ultimately, following result is proved:
Theorem (Degeratu): Let Γ be a finite subgroup of U(n) admitting a lift ˜ϵ : Γ →eU(n)
and χ be a representation of Γ. Then the η-invariant of the orbifold S2n−1/Γ twisted by the
orbi-bundle Vχ corresponding to χ is

|Γ|
X
γ ∈FF(Γ)
TrD1/2(˜ϵ(γ))
det(1 −γ) χ(γ) ,
(3.4)
which depends on the choice of ˜ϵ. Here FF(Γ) denotes the subset of Γ containing group
elements γ which act fixed point free on S2n−1.
Denoting the vector space underlying the representation by Rχ one has
Vχ = (Rχ × S2n−1)/Γ .
(3.5)
Whenever the subgroup Γfix ⊂Γ, generated by elements in the complement of FF(Γ), act
trivially on Rχ then the orbi-bundle Vχ is a vector bundle, which we will denote as Vχ, i.e.,
vector bundles are associated with a subring in Rep(Γ).
With this, it only remains to evaluate the summands. For this, consider a γ represented
as a matrix in U(n) which we may diagonalize as
γ ∼diag(exp(2πiwγ
1/ord(γ)), . . . , exp(2πiwγ
n/ord(γ)) ,
(3.6)
where ord(γ) is the order of γ ∈Γ and 0 < wγ
k < ord(γ) are non-zero positive integer weights.
The trace then evaluates to

with the sign ϵ(γ) = ±(−1)2s(γ) where s(γ) = Pn

The natural choice of sign ϵ or lift ˜ϵ will be “+”, which is induced by S2n−1/Γ being the link
of a singularity C2n/Γ (or, said more physically, the spin structure with respect to which the
fermionic degrees of freedom at the tip of the cone C2n/Γ will be formulated).

Illustrative Examples in 7D and 6D
In this section we present some illustrative examples which show how to read off anomaly
data directly from η-invariants. The examples we consider are based on supersymmetric
string / M-theory backgrounds involving the ADE singularities C2/ΓADE for ΓADE a finite
subgroup of SU(2).
M-theory on this background realizes 7D N = 1 Super Yang-Mills
theory with corresponding ADE gauge symmetry, and IIA on the same background realizes
6D N = (1, 1) Super Yang-Mills theory with corresponding ADE gauge symmetry.17 We
also show how the same methods also apply in non-supersymmetric IIA backgrounds with
orbifold singularities of the form R4/Γ for Γ a finite subgroup of U(2) ⊂Spin(4) such that
the closed string twisted sector contains a tachyon.
To present a uniform discussion, we focus on isolated singularities.18 Even in this “simpli-
fied” setting we show that η-invariant techniques detects quadratic refinements of anomalies
based on purely intersection-theoretic methods.
4.1
Mixed Anomalies of 7D Super-Yang Mills Theory
First, let us lay out the extra-dimensional construction of our system and how certain mixed
anomalies of interest are computed from bottom up field-theoretic techniques. The latter
17The case of type IIB on an ADE singularity instead results in a 6D N = (2, 0) superconformal field
theory, where the structure of higher-form symmetries is qualitatively different.
18In the supersymmetric case there is no loss of generality, but in the non-supersymmetric setting one can
in principle entertain lower codimension singularities. For a discussion of higher-form symmetries in this and
related situations involving non-supersymmetric six-manifolds, see references [31,50].

serves both as a check when recomputing anomalies from the extra-dimensional geometry in
the spirit of (1.1) and will clarify the physics of this computation.
To proceed then, let us consider M-theory on X = C2/ΓADE with finite subgroup ΓADE ⊂
SU(2). The cone X = Cone(S3/ΓADE) exhibits an isolated singularity at its tip and has
a smooth link ∂X = S3/ΓADE. To simplify the discussion further let us specialize to the
A-type singularity with ΓADE ∼= ZN. The theory TX under consideration is then maximally
supersymmetric 7D Yang-Mills theory with suN gauge algebra. This is seen, for example, in
a IIA dual frame which consists of a stack of N D6-branes with frozen center of mass mode.
This theory has a conserved current ∗(j3) ≡(∗j)4 proportional to the instanton density
Tr(F2F2) which couples to a 3-form background field C3 as

(4.1)
Following standard techniques [80, 81] we can now compute a mixed anomaly between the
2-form symmetry with background C3 and the 1-form center symmetry with background ˆB2,
valued in U(1), which arises for the choice of gauge group SU(N). For this one promotes
the SU(N) gauge theory to a U(N) gauge theory and turning on a background of the center
symmetry one has:19

With this result and context established field-theoretically, our goal now is to derive α
following the extra-dimensional approach outlined in (1.1).
Indeed, straightforwardly following the reduction procedure (2.5), i.e., reducing (2.3) on
some smooth auxiliary space Z with boundary ∂Z = ∂X by expanding H4 = B2T2 + . . . ,
one produces the term (4.7) with following extra-dimensional expression for the anomaly

for further discussion.

and w2 denotes the second Stiefel-Whitney21 class of Z.22 Next, whenever Z is complex, we
can equivalently write
α = 1
2
Z
Z
T2 (T2 + c1)
mod 1 ,
(4.14)
where c1 ≡c1(TZ) is the first Chern class of the tangent bundle of Z which realizes an
integral lift of the second Stiefel-Whitney class, i.e., c1 = w2 mod 2. This expression should
be recognized in the context of the Todd class
TdZ = 1 + 1
2c1 + 1
12(c2
1 + c2) ,
(4.15)
which relates α to the index theory of ¯∂L′ which is the ¯∂-operator twisted by some line bundle
L′ on Z with first Chern class c1(L′) = T2. We will denote by L = L′|∂Z the restriction of
the bulk line bundle L′ to the boundary ∂Z = ∂X. The first Chern class of this line bundle
21Let us further comment on the role of w2 in (4.11). Given any integral lattice, a vector w such that
v2 = w · v
mod 2 ,
(4.12)
for all lattice elements v is referred to as a characteristic vector of that lattice. There are infinite characteristic
vectors and the difference of any two such vectors is divisible by 2. It turns out that any integral lift of the
second Stiefel-Whitney class is a characteristic vector on H2(Z′; Z) where Z′ is closed 4-manifold. In this
context, (4.11) should be understood as the action of 3D Spin-Chern-Simons theory (recall we assume ∂Z to
be Spin in (2.1)) and the independence on the choice of bulk follows standard arguments by considering the
difference of two bulk choices and employing (4.12). For further details see [82]. Dually, in homology, the
second Stiefel-Whitney class is key for (4.11) to define a quadratic refinement of the bilinear linking form on
1-cycles, which we will call a self-linking. The set of quadratic refinements of this fixed bilinear form is an
affine torsor over H1(∂Z; Z2), i.e., any two choices differ by an element of H1(∂Z; Z2), exactly as the set of
Spin structures which they are in correspondence with here. More explicitly, self-linkings of closed curves
γ1 depend on the choice of framing, i.e., a trivialization of the curves normal bundle, which are classified by
Z ∼= π1(SO(2)), i.e., the winding of the orthonormal frame along the curve. A naive “division by 2” in the
definition of the linking form suffers from an ambiguity, the corresponding self-linking computed with respect
to two framings differing by 1 ∈Z will differ by 1/2. The spin-structure on ∂Z fixes this ambiguity [83],
as w2 = 0 in cohomology there is a closed 1-cochain ξ1 with values in Z2 such that dξ1 = w2 as cochains.
By adding an integral
R
γ ξ1, which suffers from an identical ambiguity, to the naive definition, all changes in
framining now lead to integer shifts. The quadratic refinements are now well-defined, but which quadratic
refinement is realized still depends on the choice of spin structure on ∂Z. The spin structure chosen follows
from the original 11D setup. Recall that ∂X = ∂Z so the spin structure on ∂Z arises as a restriction of that
chosen to formulate the 11D fermion content.
22The computation is standard and straightforward, following essentially steps outlined in [14], and we
note here the main trick, which is a formula by Wu [84] relating characteristic classes modulo 4 as
p1 = P(w2) −B(w1w2) −2(w1Sq1(w2) + w0w4)
= P(w2) + 2w4 ,
(4.13)
where in the second line, given the setting of this work, we have specialized with w0 = 1, w1 = 0 to oriented
manifolds. Notation is such that wi is the i-th Stiefel-Whitney class, P is the Pontryagin square operation, B
the Bockstein homomorphism for the sequence Z →Z →Z2 and Sqk is the k-th Steenrod square. The terms
of (4.11) quadratic and linear in T2 originate from the terms cubic and quadratic in H4 in (2.3) respectively,
with the latter computed using (4.13).

dent of the auxiliary dimension introduced back in line (2.1) used to make the Chern-Simons

with QL the charge of the line bundle L and r, s the weights of the ZN action. To define the
charge QL of the complex line bundle L, recall that every complex line bundle L on the lens
space ∂X = S3/ZN is topologically equivalent to some
LQ = (RQ × S3)/ZN ,
(4.23)
where RQ is an irreducible complex representation of ZN of charge Q ∈ZN. Then, QL ∈ZN
is simply defined as the charge of RQ ∈Rep(ZN) ∼= ZN of the equivalent LQ. For example,
the trivial line bundle has Q = 0. More generally, the charge of a line bundle L with first
Chern class t2 is determined via the canonical isomorphism
H2(S3/ZN; Z) ∼= Hom(H1(S3/ZN; Z), U(1)) ,
(4.24)
which recasts the torsional first Chern class as a holonomy mapping and, by H1(S3/ZN; Z) ∼=
ZN, as some representation RQ of ZN. With this, for A-type quotients with (r, s) = (1, N −1)

(4.25)
for line bundles L of unit charge QL = 1, matching the field theory result (4.5). The choice
of line bundle simply amounts to a choice of generator of ZN.
Let us make some further comments. First, the anomaly computation (4.21) should be
understood in the context of the bilinear linking form ℓ: H2(∂X; Z) × H2(∂X; Z) →Q/Z
on the boundary ∂X. The mapping
Q : H2(∂X; Z) →Q/Z ,

is a quadratic refinement of the bilinear linking form, i.e.,

2) −Q(t2) −Q(t′
2) .
(4.27)
See [85] for further discussion.
Second, the explicit value of the anomaly αL ∈Q/Z depends on extra-dimensional
24Here the notation ∂X = S3/ZN(r, s) denotes a quotient where S3 is realized as the unit sphere in C2
with complex coordinates z1, z2 and then acted on by the ZN action (z1, z2) 7→(ωrz1, ωsz2) with ω = 2πi/N
and gcd(N, r) = gcd(N, s) = 1.

choices, i.e., the line bundle L. That is, we can consider alternative choices for T2 entering
(4.11) and thereby different line bundles L′ with c1(L′) = T2, e.g., by redefining T2 →mT2
for any m with gcd(m, N) = 1. Such a redefinition results in α →m2α.25 Equivalently,
in line (4.7) one can change the ZN generator B2 makes reference to via the redefinition
B2 →mB2. Therefore, more invariantly, the anomaly should be viewed as given by the
entire quadratic form Q. From this perspective one can ask in what sense the anomaly is
“non-vanishing.” One way to quantify this is by the image of Q. Denote the size of the image
by |Im(Q)|. A direct computation gives |Im(Q)|/N ≤1/2 for any N, i.e., reparametrizations
fail to sweep out all possible values of the anomaly which is valued in ZN, Z2N for odd, even
N respectively. For example, when N = 5 only α = 2/5, 3/5 occur, i.e., |Im(Q)| = 2. The
anomaly is non-trivially non-zero. Further note, that when gcd(m, N) ̸= 1 scalings map us
into a subgroup. Then, whenever 23|N or p2|N with odd prime p, there exist subgroups for
which the mixed anomaly α vanishes.
Third, other ADE singularities may of course be analyzed analogously. Let us sketch this
for quotients by the D-type dicyclic group D2n with 8n elements and 2n+3 conjugacy classes.
Using the conjugacy classes we can count the Dynkin nodes and, with this parametrization,
identify the engineered gauge algebra as so(4n+4). For such singularities, instead of (4.22),
one now starts from (3.9) which for the current setup takes the form

(4.28)
The denominator is with respect to the 2D represention realized in the geometric engineering
construction, i.e., the D-type singularity C2/D2n itself. The numerator features the char-
acter of the four 1D representations of D2n which are the trivial, spinor, co-spinor, vector
representation abbreviated t, s, c, v respectively. As before, the fields of the SymTFT follow
from reduction of H4 along the classes

not spoil quadratic scalings).

which agrees with intersection theoretic methods (which we mention momentarily in (4.34)).
Fourth, let us highlight some technical features we will encounter in other settings. Note
that there are three distinct ways the geometric data is parametrized above. For the first two,
which are with respect to the boundary ∂X = ∂Z, consider, e.g., (4.22) and (4.24). There we
have either a cohomological or a representation theoretic presentation of the line bundle L.
The former is preferred by integrated index densities while the latter is preferred by explicit
expressions of η-invariants, which are representation theoretic. The third parametrization
that has been in use in the literature is in contrast homological. Although not explicitly
discussed by us here one can also compute the bulk integral (4.14) via the intersection ring
of Z. For example, when Z is explicitly chosen to be a crepant resolution of the singularity
C2/ZN, with N −1 exceptional curves Ek, then T2 can be dualized via the intersection
pairing to
T 2 ≡1

X

(4.34)
see [86] for further details. With respect to this homological parametrization and the anomaly
is computed by T 2 · T 2/2 modulo 1. This should be thought of as specifying the line bundle
L′ via a divisor T 2 of Z. When matching and checking different approaches, in the general
case, we will have to carefully translate between these different presentations of data.
Finally, note that there is yet another way to arrive at (4.25). As beautifully explained
in [87] the terms entering index theorems, such as in (4.16), are not invariant upon deforming
22


Z, individual contributions to the index can be traded off between terms. In particular, one
could have picked Z = X = C2/ΓADE, i.e., a singular Z. Away from the tip of the cone
both the metric and bundle curvature are flat, the integrated index densities have now been
localized to the tip of the cone and can be evaluated using fixed point methods [76]. This fits
into a wider programme of orbifold index theory developed for example, in part, in [77,88].
4.2
Mixed Anomalies of Non-SUSY 6D String Backgrounds
Our discussion so far has been topological. In section 4.1 we considered supersymmetric ADE
singularities in order to readily check our extra-dimensional approach against field-theoretic
approaches, but the holomorphicity underlying these examples was never utilized. Overall,
the general expectation is that extra-dimensional approaches to symmetry theories apply to
non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric backgrounds alike, as for example demonstrated
in [31,50] for a variety of settings.
Here, we will briefly consider IIA string theory on R4/Γ with Γ some finite subgroup
of U(2) ⊂Spin(4).27 The closed string spectrum of the 6D system engineered by such a
background has twisted sector tachyons [89–92] and is unstable against their condensation.
However, as these localize to fixed loci, this condensation turns out to be neatly characterized
by desingularizations of R4/Γ, i.e., one has a rolling solution with X

t=t0 = R4/Γ as initial
condition at some initial time t0. Even with such an instability it is a well-posed problem
to discuss defect groups and generalized symmetries of such systems, and their anomalies
[31]. Further, the geometry remains reliable in parametrizing these structures, even when
microscopically they are now tied to fermionic data [31, 50]. Then, the discussion of the
previous section straightforwardly carries over, the 6D system has a mixed anomaly between
a discrete and continuous 1-form symmetry

with field strength G3 = dC2 where C2 is the background field for the continuous 1-form
symmetry and B2 is the background field for the discrete 1-form symmetry. For example,
the space C2/ZN(1, 1) has αL = (1 −N)/2N and C2/Z3N+1(1, 3) has αL = −3N/(6N + 2)
which we both evaluated via (4.22) with respect to a line bundle L of charge QL = 1.
27Due to fermionic degrees of freedom in the system the background is specified by a subgroup Γ ⊂Spin(4).
We shall assume that the group action has a fixed point at the tip of the cone, but that the system contains
no additional singularities.28 The metric is only acted on by the pushforward subgroup in SO(4) which is
the isometry group of S3. It is the latter which is relevant for the anomaly considerations presented here.

Anomalies of 5D SCFTs
We now turn to study the anomalies of 1-form symmetries of 5D SCFTs engineered by
Calabi-Yau orbifolds X = C3/Γ in M-theory.
We separate these geometries into three
classes:
• Case 1: Isolated singularities C3/ZN.
• Case 2: Non-isolated singularities C3/ZN.
• Case 3: All other cases C3/Γ, i.e., non-cyclic Γ.
The cases are such that in case 1 we can focus on generalizing our discussion in section
4 with minimally added technical complications. From there, we then focus in case 2 on the
discussion of symmetry data in stratified systems, as sketched in section 2.2. Case 3 then
serves to demonstrate that methods straightforwardly extend to non-cyclic quotients and
non-toric geometries.
5.1
Isolated Orbifold Singularities (Γ ∼= ZN)
We now consider 5D SCFTs engineered by the Calabi-Yau orbifold singularities X = C3/Γ
with finite Γ ⊂SU(3) in M-theory. Demanding an isolated singularity already determines
Γ ∼= ZN with odd N.29 The defect group (2.10) is then simply
D = D(1)
elec ⊕D(2)
mag ∼= ZN ⊕ZN ,
(5.1)
and the line operators D(1)
elec are acted on by a 1-form symmetry A ∼= ZN with background
field B2. Focusing purely on this 1-form symmetry we observe that there may be two types
of anomalies as recorded by the SymTFT couplings

where p1 is the first Pontryagin class of the SymTFT spacetime which we will assume to be
divisible by 4. With this the couplings β, γ ∈Q/Z quantify a 1-form self-anomaly and a
mixed 1-form-gravitational anomaly.
The action (5.2) is considered mod 1 and consequently β, γ are physical only up to certain
redundancies. These redundancies are quantified by the index theory of the Dirac operator
defined on the 6D SymTFT spacetime M. Whenever B2 is compactly supported (allowing
29For an isolated singularity Γ must be cyclic. Consider Γ ∼= ZN and assume that N were even, then all
weights of the group action would have to be odd for an isolated singularity, however in this case the sum
of the three weights would be odd, in particular, the sum does not vanish modulo N and X would not be

(5.3)
With this β, γ are not unique in (5.2). The pair (β, γ) suffers from a Z6 ambiguity.30 This
ambiguity is such that the combination
α = β + γ ,
(5.4)
remains fixed. Importantly, note that α does not set any physical anomaly itself as β, γ
transform differently under redefinitions of B2, and consequently β + γ is not appropriately
covariant.31
Nonetheless α has a favorable extra-dimensional presentation with respect to ∂X, much
as in (4.21), allowing for closed form evaluation, which also results in closed form expressions
for β and γ up to their common Z6 ambiguity.
We now discuss this boundary presentation following similar steps as in section 4. To
begin, let Z be some smooth Spin manifold with boundary ∂Z = S5/ZN and T2 ∈H2(Z; Z)
a free class that restricts on the boundary S5/ZN to a generator t2 ∈H2(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= ZN.
Then, expanding (2.1) with G4 = B2T2 + . . . and matching to (5.2) one finds
α =

(5.6)
This expression (5.6) for α should be recognized in the context of the ˆA-genus
ˆAZ = 1 −1
24p1 ,
(5.7)
which relates α to the index of the Dirac operator /D twisted by some line bundle L′ over Z
with first Chern class c1(L′) = T2. This is made precise by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index
30Let us contrast this to two related Z6 ambiguities. Consider for example the C3G4G4 term. Reducing it
naively in singular cohomology on the link ∂Z one finds a linking number “multiplied by 1/6.” Division by 6
is ill-defined over Q/Z and thus a Z6 ambiguity arises. Identical considerations apply to β. The point is that
(5.3) renders a combination of these ambiguities non-physical. The remaining of these naive ambiguities is
removed by having included an auxiliary bulk in (2.1) for well-definition of the 11D Chern-Simons term.
31For example, for the 5D SCFT engineered by the orbifold C3/Z5(1, 1, 3) the combination α takes, for
the four different choices of generator of Z5, the values
α = 0, −1
5, +1
5, 0 .
(5.5)
In contrast, anomalies being non-vanishing should not depend on generator choices.

We have the Chern character ch(L′) = exp(T2) and that L ≡L′|∂Z. The boundary terms are
set by, respectively, the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer η-invariant and the dimension of the kernel of
the induced twisted tangential Dirac operator given in (3.3).
One now obtains a closed form expression for α as a function of ∂Z = S5/ZN(m1, m2, m3).32
Note that ∂Z has positive sectional curvature implying dim Ker( /D∂, L) = 0 by Lichnerowicz-

with primitive root of unity ω = exp(2πi/N).33 Here, exactly as in (4.21), we have made the
dependence on the line bundle L explicit via adding an index ‘L’ to α. Again, QL denotes
the charge of the line bundle: Given some 1D irreducible representation RQ of ZN of charge
Q we can construct a complex line bundle LQ = (RQ ×S5)/ZN and any complex line bundle,
as classified by its first Chern class, has a representative given by some LQ.
When evaluating (5.8) we must, in order to consistently evaluate the bulk and bound-
ary terms with respect to the same basis, either determine the first Chern class c1(LQ) or
alternatively determine the charge QL of the line bundle L with first Chern class c1(L) = t2.
We achieve this by expressing both of these parametrizations of line bundles with respect to
a preferred basis of the cohomology ring of S5/ZN, which in particular contains the group
H2(S5/ZN; Z), as put forward by Kawasaki [93].
To proceed then, we first review Kawasaki’s parametrization. The cohomology ring of
S5/ZN(m1, m2, m3) may be related to the cohomology ring of CP2 following [93].
This
relation establishes a set of preferred generators for the groups H2k(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= ZN corre-
sponding to the generators of the free groups H2k(CP2; Z) ∼= Z for k = 1, 2. Let us denote
the former by v2, w4 and the latter by u2, u2
2 respectively. Then
v2 = qu2 ,
w4 = pu2

(5.10)
32Here S5/ZN(m1, m2, m3) denotes a ZN action with positive integer weights mi presented as 0 ≤mi < N.
The action is (z1, z2, z3) 7→(ωm1z1, ωm2z2, ωm3z3) on the three complex coordinates of a C3 with respect to
which S5 is thought of as the unit sphere. For isolated CY singularities we have odd N and gcd(mk, N) = 1.

This determines the ring structure of cohomology ring. However, this parametrization is

respect to the cohomology ring of CP2. For this one defines the integer

(5.13)
which should be viewed as formally cupping v2 with w4 mod x6. Identifying the link pairing
with the holonomy mapping (viewing v2 as a field strength and w4 as dual to a curve) the
isomorphism
H2(S5/ZN) ∼= Hom(H1(S5/ZN), U(1)) ∼= Hom(ZN, U(1)) ,
(5.14)
is seen to assign to a line bundle L on S5/ZN with first Chern class c1(L) = v2 the represen-
tation of charge Q(v2) = QL = q ∈ZN. We will denote this preferred line bundle therefore
as Lq and fix it as a generator of the Picard group of S5/ZN.
Finally, there is again another way to parametrize line bundles L on S5/ZN by appealing
to the isomorphism H2(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= H3(S5/ZN; Z) and by thinking of S5/ZN as the bound-
ary to C3/ZN. The line bundle L can be thought of as a restriction of a line bundle L′ on
C3/ZN (or its toric resolution if one wants to work in the smooth category) to the boundary
S5/ZN. The bulk complex line bundle may then be characterized by a bulk divisor. From
this perspective, line bundles which are non-trivial on the boundary S5/ZN are characterized
by some non-compact divisor of C3/ZN modulo compact divisors. There are three natural
non-compact divisors obtained by setting one of the three complex coordinates to zero. Let
us consider Dz3 ≡{z3 = 0} ⊂C3/ZN.34 This divisor meets the boundary in a 3-cycle.
From this perspective there exists yet another integer s3 such that s3Dz3, restricted to the
boundary, is dual to the Kawasaki generator v2 ∈H2(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= ZN. For example, this
integer is such that s3Dz3 has a triple intersection mod 1 given by q3/r which is v3
2 mod x6.
34The choices Dz1, Dz2 are equally good, however, we have parametrized the examples written out explicitly
in this note such that formulae are especially simple for the choice Dz3.

q is not unique, however it uniquely restricts to
the boundary S5/ZN(m1, m2, m3) realizing a line bundle Lq with charge QLq = q ∈ZN with
reference to Kawasaki’s preferred generator, i.e., simultaneously c1(Lq) = v2 ∈H2(S5/ZN) and
choice of generator v2 ≡1 ∈ZN. Further, classes in H2(S5/ZN) are Poincar´e dual to 3-cycles
H3(S5/ZN) ∼= ZN. The equation z3 = 0 cuts out a non-compact divisor of C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3)
denoted Dz3 which intersects the boundary S5/ZN in a 3-cycle. The column labelled s3 specifies
this 3-cycle, as an element s−1
3
∈ZN, with respect to Kawasaki’s generator. The divisor s3Dz3 is
one good choice for L′
q. For example, in the toric resolution of C3/ZN the triple intersection of
s3Dz3 modulo 1 and the linking of v2
2 with v2 in S5/ZN agree. We also give the Dirac index which,
on the other hand, depends on bulk data of L′
q here fixed by s3Dz3 (and computed with respect to
a particular toric resolution as specified by the Delaunay Triangulation of the toric diagram, see
figure 3 for the diagrams of the first family). The anomalies β, γ are the pure 1-form anomaly and
the mixed 1-form-gravitational anomaly.
In table 1 we list some 1-parameter families of toric isolated Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities
and compute their combination α with respect to the Kawasaki choice of generator and
further give the integers q, s3 (mod N) relating these to other parameterizations picking out

Let us comment on our computations. First, we checked these against the bulk inter-
section computations directly evaluating (5.6) for the choice Z being the toric resolution of
C3/ZN. Indeed, this is how we determined the integer s3. See appendix A.1 for an example
of such a computation. Second, note that the η-invariant, for the families of geometries
parametrized by n, computes for any of our examples to the form

Lq(∂X(n)) = P (q)
2 (n)
N(n) ,
(5.18)
with a degree two polynomial P (q)

whose 3 coefficients are functions of the 3 weights mk. This
structure makes it straightforward to extrapolate and determine closed form expressions for
multi-family classes of examples, using code, such as in (5.16). Third, except for the twisted
Dirac index, which depends on explicit choices for the bulk Z and extension data of the
boundary line bundle, the results in table 1 only depend on the boundary and bundle L.
Finally, let us give closed form boundary expressions for the 1-form self-anomaly and
mixed 1-form gravitational anomaly. From 1

Non-Isolated Orbifold Singularities (Γ ∼= ZN)
Next, consider 5D SCFTs engineered by non-ioslated singularities X = C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3)
with gk ≡gcd(N, mk) > 1 for at least one weight mk. For each such gk the sphere S5 ⊂C3
has the circle cut out by zi, zj = 0 with {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} as a fixed locus. In S5/ZN this
fixed locus projects to a circle worths of Agk−1 A-type ADE singularity. These circles fill into
(up to three) cones, also cut out by zi, zj = 0 with {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, of Agk−1 singularities
in X which are modeled on C/ZN/gk. Away from the tip of the cone X these are disjoint.
See figure 2. Next, introduce the product g = g1g2g3. Then, the defect group (2.10) is

much as in (5.2), and again β, γ ∈Q/Z set a 1-form self-anomaly, mixed 1-form-gravitational

(see subsection 2.3):

(5.22)
which has two consequences of interest for us here. First, denoting the field strength of the

These contributions to the SymTFT are strictly beyond singular cohomology (the Cartan

Figure 2: We sketch the geometry X = C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3). The picture depicts the singularities
S which consist of up to three 2D cones cut out by coordinate planes. Each cone supports an
A-type ADE singularity in codimension-4.
This singularity enhances at the tip of the cone at
z1, z2, z3 = 0 where the singularity enhances to codimension-6 (where the 5D SCFT is supported).
where the first term is inferred from the defect group (5.20), associated with discrete ZN/g
symmetries, and the second term is determined following, e.g., the discussion in [30], with
h(k)
4
gauge fields valued in su(gk).
Second, the 0-form flavor symmetry and the 1-form symmetry may combine into a 2-
group with 4-term sequence38
1 →A →eA →eF →F →1 ,
(5.28)
where eA ∼= Z∨
N, A ∼= Z∨
N/g is the 1-form symmetry group, eF = SU(g1) × SU(g2) × SU(g3)
is the simply connected group with Lie algebra f and F is the flavor symmetry group of the
system, see discussion in the context of (2.14). Whenever gcd(N, g) ̸= 1 this is the sequence
of a non-trivial 2-group structure, and, e.g., the short exact sequence (2.12) does not split.
To this 2-group structure an interesting anomaly may be attached.
Let us motivate
this anomaly by “naive” computations in singular cohomology.
For this begin with the
observation
H2(∂X; Z) ∼= (Γ/Γfix)∨⊂Pic(∂X) ∼= Γ∨,
(5.29)
with Γfix ∼= Zg, the 1-form symmetry group (Γ/Γfix)∨∼= Z∨
N/g ∼= A and the Picard group
Pic(∂X). Here dualization via ∨is crucial for the subgroup relation. The subgroup H2(∂X; Z)
of the Picard group is in correspondence with complex line bundles on ∂X. Elements outside
of this subgroup are invertible sheaves (or orbi-line bundles). These are of course ordinary
bundles away from the singularities, i.e., we have
H2(∂X◦; Z) ∼= Pic(∂X) ∼= Γ∨,
(5.30)
38The tilde here and in related notation, e.g., eB(N)
2
, are unrelated to resolutions of the geometry, e.g., e
X.
31


where ∂X◦is a manifold with boundary obtained by excision of a tubular neighborhood
T(∂S ) of the asymptotic singular locus. See the discussion in section 2.2.
With this now consider the stratified construction in [34] which assigns a symmetry
theory to ∂X◦characterizing symmetry structures of the 5D SCFT. At a technical level, one
requires a reduction scheme for manifolds with boundary, we refer to [34] for further details
and will simply sketch relevant steps here. To proceed then, consider expanding the C3G4G4
term with respect to Hm(∂X◦; Z) and Hm(∂X◦, ∂2X◦; Z) modulo identifications induced by
the long exact sequence in relative homology of the pair (∂X◦, ∂2X◦).39 As in a normal
reduction scheme we must contract the internal cocycles and, from these considerations, the
following triple product arises
(H2(∂X◦, ∂2X◦; Z)/H1(∂2X◦)) × (H2(∂X◦, ∂2X◦; Z)/H1(∂2X◦)) × H2(∂X◦; Z) →Q/Z ,
(5.31)
where all groups are torsional and which may be rewritten as
Tor H2(∂X; Z) × Tor H2(∂X; Z) × Tor H2(∂X◦; Z) →Q/Z .
(5.32)
Geometrically, the triple product is realized as a cup product between the first two factors,
resulting in a class in Tor H4(∂X; Z), which is then linked with the final factor. Written
with respect to 2-group data this triple product is simply
T : A × A × eA →Q/Z .
(5.33)
Restricting the last entry to the subgroup A ⊂eA we have T |A : A3 = H2(∂X; Z)3 →Q/Z
which relates to the 1-form self-anomaly, more precisely evaluating on (1, 1, 1) gives 6β.
Unfortunately, the naive computation of expanding C3G4G4 (and other terms) in singular
cohomology classes of course runs into the issue that the link pairing above is multiplied by
1/6, which is ill-defined over Q/Z. In the above considerations employing ∂X◦and ∂2X◦
adding an auxiliary bulk to settle this division by 6 is not straightforward. Even so, note
that T |A is precisely the triple product which refined via 1/6 to the 1-form self-anomaly β.
Indeed, ignoring the singularities we would have written identical expression to (5.6) with
T2 inducing a generator of H2(∂X; Z).
Overall, we are lead to two natural conjectures. First, the anomalies β, γ in (5.26) remain
computable via η-invariants even in the presence of singularities. Second, we expect to be

can be reliably computed using singular cohomology.

able to refine anomaly computations according to the short exact sequences:
1 →A →eA →eA/A →1
1 →H2(∂X; Z) →H2(∂X◦; Z) →H2(∂X◦; Z)/H2(∂X; Z) →1
1 →Z∨
N/g →Z∨
N →Z∨
g →1
(5.34)
Here we have given the short exact sequence for symmetries, its incarnation in geometry and
its explicit evaluation for the examples under consideration.
Our goal, is now to first compute the anomalies β, γ, δk, ϵk, given in (5.26), and subse-
quently discuss refinements due to (5.34).
5.2.1
Anomaly Computations for Singular Boundaries via η-Invariants
We now compute the anomalies β, γ, δk, ϵk presented in (5.26) beginning with the pair β, γ.
To begin, we deform the 5D SCFT TX to its Coulomb branch. Geometrically, this defor-
mation is realized by some toric resolution of X = C3/ZN. Previously massless excitations
may pick up masses, however the lattice of charges realized by dynamical excitations remains
unchanged. As a consequence the 1-form symmetry is unaltered, including anomalies related
thereto [49]. The toric resolution in particular smooths the boundary ∂X and applying our
results from section 5.1 we immediately conclude

(5.35)
where eL is a line bundle on ∂e
X = ^
S5/ZN. The applicability and interpretation of this result
requires some further specifications. First, note that we have
H2(∂X; Z) ∼= ZN/g ,
H2(∂e
X; Z) ∼= Zrk(f) ⊕ZN/g ,
(5.36)
with rk(f) denoting the rank of the flavor symmetry algebra f.40 Therefore, line bundles on
∂X and line bundles on ∂e
X with torsional first Chern class are in 1:1 correspondence. We
will denote the latter by eLQ and importantly, due to the subgroup relation (5.29), the charge
Q takes values in ZN/g ⊂ZN or equivalently takes values in ZN quantized in units of g
Q ∈{0, g, 2g, 3g, . . . } ∼= ZN/g ⊂ZN .
(5.37)
Contracting the exceptional locus we obtain a pushforward eLQ →LQ where LQ is simply
a line bundle on ∂X with charge Q as introduced below (5.9). By direct computation we
40The torsion subgroup is unaffected by resolution, which can be explicitly seen from the perspective of
vanishing cycles. Dualizing to singular homology ZN/g is accounted for by H1(∂X; Z) due to the universal
coefficient theorem and adding or removing 2-cycles leaves this group of 1-cycles invariant.

Here, the left hand side is computed via the bulk integral given in (5.6). The right hand side

bulk computation.
To give the η-invariant of the orbifold S5/ZN introduce the subset of Γ ∼= ZN consisting
of group elements which act without fixed point on S5. We write
FF(Γ) = {γ ∈Γ : 1 ̸∈Eigenvalues(γSU(3))} ,
(5.39)
in the obvious notation. For Γ ∼= ZN we have Γ \ FF(γ) ∼= Zg ∼= Γfix but whenever Γ is
non-cyclic we will have Γ \ FF(γ) ̸∼= Γfix and |Γ \ FF(γ)| < |Γfix|. In any case, one then has

Table 2: List of η-invariants of S5/ZN associated to the Dirac operator /DL′q on C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3)
twisted by a line bundle L′
q.
We consider non-isolated singularities C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3) which
have singular links S5/ZN.
The line bundle L′
q is not unique, however it uniquely restricts to
the boundary S5/ZN(m1, m2, m3) realizing a line bundle Lq with charge QLq = q ∈ZN with
reference to Kawasaki’s preferred generator, i.e., simultaneously c1(Lq) = v2 ∈H2(S5/ZN; Z) and
choice of generator v2 ≡1 ∈ZN. Further, classes in H2(S5/ZN; Z) are Poincar´e dual to 3-cycles
H3(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= ZN. The equation z3 = 0 cuts out a non-compact divisor of C3/ZN(m1, m2, m3)
denoted Dz3 which intersects the boundary S5/ZN in a 3-cycle. The column labelled s3 specifies
this 3-cycle, as an element s−1
3
∈ZN, with respect to the Kawasaki’s generator. The divisor s3Dz3
is one good choice for L′
q. For example, in the toric resolution of C3/ZN the triple intersection of
s3Dz3 modulo 1 and the linking of v2
2 with v2 in S5/ZN agree. The anomalies β, γ are the pure
1-form anomaly and the mixed 1-form-gravitational anomaly. We also give the η-invariants where
we have lifted the quantization condition restricting us to H2(S5/ZN; Z) ⊂Pic(S5/ZN).
Next, we turn to discuss the anomalies δk. These originate from a Wess-Zumino term
S(k)
WZ =

supported on the k-th component of the non-compact codimension-4 singularities (of which
there are up to three, see figure 2).42
To proceed, note that asymptotically each such stack is wrapped on S1/ZN = S1/ZN/gk
where we have quotiented out the subgroup fixing the circle. We have
[S1/ZN/gk] = g1g2g3/gk = gigj ∈ZN/g ∼= H1(S5/ZN; Z) ,
{i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} ,
(5.44)
which is Poincar´e-dual to gigj ∈ZN/g ⊂H4(S5/ZN; Z) ∼= ZN with respect to Kawasaki’s
generator. Let us denote the corresponding 4-cocycle by t(ij)
4
. Then, via the standard trick of
completing the integral in (5.43) to the full space by extending the integrand by the cocycle
42In the IIA setting with a stack of D6-branes, this is the familiar WZ term coupling the RR 3-form
potential to the instanton density.

{i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} .
(5.46)
Next, we turn to discuss the anomalies ϵk. As we now explain, this descend from the
localized 7D Super Yang-Mills theory sector. Observe that we can introduce a chemical
potential for the third Chern class of the gauge bundle, i.e., a Wess-Zumino term:
S(k)
WZ =

2(2π)2
Z

(5.47)
which is supported on the k-th component of the non-compact codimension-4 singularities
(of which there are up to three, see figure 2).43 We focus now on the local model Lock of the
k-th flavor brane which fits into the fibration
C2/Zgk ,→Lock →
 (C/ZN/gk) \ {0}

.
(5.48)
In the base we have excised the origin z1, z2, z3 = 0 where the different flavor branes meet
(and the singularity enhances and where the 5D SCFT is localized). Importantly, Lock is
not a direct product. The base has a non-trivial circle and traversing it the overall quotient
is such that the normal geometry is acted on by a ZN/gk(mi, mj) with {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}.
Focusing on the Hopf circle in S3/Zgk ⊂C2/Zgk this gives a circle bundle with flat connection
C1. From here we compute
ϵk = mk
N ,
(5.49)
see [34] for further discussion.
5.2.2
Anomaly Refinements via η-Invariants
One conclusion of our discussion on the pure 1-form anomaly and mixed 1-form-gravitational
anomaly for 5D SCFTs was that due to the subgroup relation
ZN/g ∼= H2(∂X; Z) ⊂H2(∂X◦) ∼= Pic(∂X) ∼= ZN ,
(5.50)
43In the IIA setting this term would arise from the WZ term involving the coupling of the RR 1-form po-
tential to the third Chern character. In the lift to M-theory the RR 1-form potential becomes the component
of the spin connection along the circle used for the reduction.

2η /D

(5.51)
was quantized in units of g, see (5.37), or equivalently that Q must be associated with a line

η /D(S5/ZN) :
Rep(ZN) →Q/Z ,
Q 7→1
2η /D

LQ = β1Q3 + γ1Q
mod 1 ,
(5.53)
whose homogenous pieces we related to anomalies, i.e., the η-invariant plays the role of a
generating function for the SCFT 1-form anomalies.44
Naturally, the question arises which anomaly data is recorded by the unrestricted function
(5.52) associated with eA ∼= ZN in (5.34). With this, the obvious way in proceeding to refine
the 1-form anomaly discussion is then to simply drop this quantization condition. For any
element L ∈Pic(∂X) of the Picard group we define mod 1

The elements L are invertible sheaves or orbifold line bundles which, unlike the line bundles
so far, carry additional structure localized to the non-compact singularities / flavor branes.
We pause to demonstrate via an example that there is indeed strictly more information
in eαL than in αL. Explicitly, consider the family of geometries Xn = C3/Z2n(1, 1, 2n −2).
44Here, anomalies are expressed respect to some choice of generator 1 ∈ZN/g, this makes automatic that
and βQ = β1Q3 and γQ = γ1Q have the correct transformation properties to multiply a term cubic and
linear in the 1-form background as in (5.26). Note that the η-invariant takes this functional form only mod
1 (over Q quadratic pieces appear).

in Q. Fixing n, there are up to 8 types of terms given by monomials Qk with k = 0, . . . , 3
multiplied by (−1)Q or not. The function (−1)Q is related to Zg ∼= Z2 in this case and, more
generally, g-th roots of unity appear. In contrast to (5.53), even when (5.55) is considered
mod 1 terms other than those proportional to Q3 and Q need to be specified. See tables 2
and 5 for some further evaluated examples.
We now conjecture which anomaly information is encoded in (5.54). For this we include
background fields for the flavor brane 1-form symmetries into our symmetry theory. At a
computational level this is straightforward, we simply apply the methods which produced
(4.4) starting from (4.1) to the SymTFT action (5.26) and obtain

(5.57)
Note, in (5.56) we have dropped the labelling “SymTFT.” Nonetheless, the above results can
be given a symmetry theory interpretation, following [34], which is that S(anom)
CDHHT is associated
with a 6D symmetry theory, derived from ∂X◦which is relative to the 7D symmetry theory
associated to ∂2X◦which is associated to the flavor branes. See [34] for the discussion of
the 7D theory and the 6D/7D boundary conditions.
Returning to our original observation centered on (5.52) we conjecture that the anomalies
β, γ, eδk,eϵk are all encoded in the twisted η-invariants (5.54) of the boundary S5/ZN.
The reason for this conjecture is (5.34) suggesting that B(N/g)
2
, B(g)
2
combines into a B(N)
2
associated internally with a generator of H2(∂X◦; Z) ∼= Pic(∂X) ∼= ZN and the fact that
(5.56) only contains the fields B(N/g)
2
, B(g)
2 .

The relevance of this to our discussion is as follows. The space ∂X◦is also a topological
model for the boundary of
X \ T(S ) ,
(5.58)
i.e., the full internal geometry with a tubular neighborhood of the full singular locus excised.
As such X \ T(S ) is the maximal region on which the 11D supergravity approximation is
accurate and the action (5.56), computed with respect to the smooth manifold with boundary
∂X◦, records the strongest topological constraints on the physics of T(S ) which may be
derived from 11D supergravity.
Given this maximality, a good question is: Does the symmetry data encoded in S(anom)
CDHHT
uniquely determine a 5D SCFT among the set of 5D SCFTs? Among the set of 5D SCFTs
with extra-dimensional construction in M-theory on a Calabi-Yau three-folds X = C3/ZN,
does the function (5.52) uniquely determine a 5D SCFT?
As a related comment, observe that the restriction (5.53) cannot distinguish between 5D
SCFTs with trivial D(1).
5.3
Non-Isolated Orbifold Singularities (Non-Cyclic Γ)
We now discuss anomalies of 5D SCFTs associated with quotients by non-cyclic Γ, starting
with non-Abelian Γ and then, for completeness, also discuss the case Γ ∼= ZN × ZM. Given
the evidence in previous section we assume that the anomalies β, γ of 5D SCFTs engineered
by C3/Γ, as written in (5.2), are computed for arbitrary quotients by η-invariants, i.e., (5.38)
is assumed to hold beyond toric examples.
To proceed, we focus now on the subset of M-theory backgrounds C3/Γ with non-Abelian
Γ ⊂SU(3) which engineer 5D SCFTs with non-trivial defect group.45 Such groups Γ and
their presentations were given in [48], and were found to all be small subgroups of SU(3)
[94].46 Small subgroups derive from finite subgroups of U(2) and as such are related to the
binary dihedral (D), binary tetrahedral (T), binary octahedral (O), binary icosahedral (I)
groups.
We now present a self-contained parametrization of these small groups, taken from [48],
45See [46] for explicit computations of the toric resolutions.
46A group G ⊂GL(n, C) is referred to as small if it contains no elements g ∈G with exactly n −1 many
eigenvalues equal to 1 (i.e., G contains no reflections).

Table 4: η-invariant computations and 1-form anomaly computations for small Γ ⊂SU(3).
The 1-form anomalies compute from a sum over elements in FF(Γ) following (3.8).
We present our anomaly computations in table 4. Here, we follow the steps outline in
section 3 and compute with respect to following representation ρ. Given the element γ ∈Γ
(for Γ ̸= T (3)
m , D(m even)
n,q
) we represent it as a word
γ = Y y
M . . . BbAa ,
(5.62)
with integers y, . . . , b, a and appropriate M. Then, we set ρ(γ) = ωy with
ω = exp(2πi/|Ab(Γ/Γfix)|) ,
(5.63)
which is the representation induced by a representation of the Abelianization of Γ/Γfix which
sends the fixed point free generator YM to ω. For Γ = T (3)
m , D(m even)
n,q
we proceed identically
with powers of Y6mC, Y4mA counted by y respectively. Unfortunately, we do not find closed
form expressions for the families Om, Im. The η-invariant relates to the β’s and γ’s as (5.19).
Finally, we discuss Abelian non-cyclic quotients by groups Γ ∼= ZN × ZM with M > 1
dividing N (every Abelian subgroup of SU(3) must be of this type [95]).
Such actions
admits a canonical parametrization with weights ZN(m1, m2, m3) and ZM(0, 1, M −1) and
gcd(N, m1) and M coprime.
In this parametrization, all elements of the ZM subgroup generated by (0, 1) fix subsets
of the boundary. As such, the defect group and higher symmetry groups of the 5D SCFT TX
engineered by C3/Γ in M-theory are determined by the ZN factor, placing us largely into the
setup of section 5.2. Our discussion there can then essentially be carried over, up to a minor

technical detail in computing the 1-form self- and the mixed 1-form-gravitational anomaly.
This detail concerns the evaluation of the η-invariant (3.4). Instead of (5.40), the sum
runs now over |FF(Γ)| elements which we now count. First, introduce M ′ = N/M. Then,
the k-th circle S1
k ⊂S5 cut out by zi, zj = 0 with {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} is fixed by the subgroup
ZMgcd(M′,m1) ⊂Γ (i.e., there are always three flavor branes [61]). These groups only share
the identity element of Γ. If any one group element were to fix two such circles, it would fix
a full 3-sphere containing these, this however, would be in contradiction with the orbifold
C3/Γ being Calabi-Yau, which constrains singularities to be codimension-6 or codimension-4
and not codimension-2. With this we count

Table 6: Table 5 continued. We list the 1-form anomaly data for some families Γ ∼= ZN × ZM.
In the absence of Kawasaki’s canonical generator, we compute here using the line bundle
LQ associated to the charge Q = N/|Γ/Γfix| representation of ZN and refinements are given
with respect to Q = 1. In particular, as the ZM factor does not affect 1-form symmetries or
line defects, we set all representations of ZM to the trivial representation.
Finally, we turn to generalize the refinement discussion given in subsection 5.2.2 for the
cyclic case Γ. We begin by discussing the flavor symmetry anomalies in (5.43) and (5.47).
The term (5.43) makes sense for all ADE types as basic invariant polynomials of degree 2
exists for all simply laced Lie algebras. In contrast, the term (5.47) relies on the existence
of an invariant degree 3 polynomial, which only exists as TrF 3 for A-type Lie algebras [96],
and therefore such terms, and consequently anomalies ϵk, must be absent for flavor branes
of type D and E.
Finally note that the natural generalization of (5.52) is
η /D(S5/Γ) :
Rep(Γ) →Q/Z ,
R 7→1
2η /D
VR
mod 1 ,
(5.66)
where VR = (R×S5)/Γ is an orbi-bundle. Instead of a single variable Q as in the cyclic case
(see, e.g., (5.55)), we expect that the function (5.66) may be expressed as quasi-polynomial
with respect to as many variables as Rep(Γ) has generators and coefficients in this polynomial
carry anomaly data. We leave a detailed investigation of this structure to future work.

Conclusions
In this paper we studied anomalies of 5D, 6D, 7D theories engineered by orbifolds X = Cn/Γ
in string and M-theory. We determined these as functions of ∂X = S2n−1/Γ by expressing
them using η-invariants.
Concretely, for all 5D SCFTs constructed by the Calabi-Yau orbifolds C3/Γ in M-theory,
43


we computed, for the discrete 1-form symmetry

The extra-dimensional line bundle LQ over ∂X determines an internal basis for a dimensional
reduction scheme with respect to which SymTFT terms we computed starting from topo-
logical terms of 11D supergravity. We matched these results with intersection computation
which constitute the previous standard in the literature.
We provided evidence and conjectured that full set of twisted η-invariants of the Dirac
operator mod 1, which may be collected into the function
η /D(S5/Γ) :
Rep(Γ) →Q/Z ,
R 7→1

(6.4)
on the set of orbi-bundles VR = (R × S5)/Γ, determines all anomalies between to the 1-
form symmetry and non-Abelian flavor symmetries of the system. The obvious K-theoretic
generalization of (6.4), when X is not a global quotient, is
η /D(∂X) :
K0(∂X) →Q/Z ,
V 7→1
2η /D
V (∂X)

(6.5)
This gave rise to an interesting open question concerning how heavily a SCFT is constrained
by its generalized symmetries is:
Among the set of 5D SCFTs with extra-dimensional construction in M-theory on a Calabi-
Yau three-fold X, does the function η /D(∂X) uniquely determine a 5D SCFT?
The precise interpretation of η /D(∂X) away from the subring of vector bundles also re-
quires more attention and technical clarification. It is interesting to note that η-invariants
are bordism invariants and it would be of interest to connect the anomaly considerations in
this note to the study of generalized charges as characterized by bordism groups [97–107].
Further, this paper demonstrated (perhaps unsurprisingly), that anomaly structures in
geometric engineering can require refinements beyond singular cohomology, and are per-
44


haps better formulated in K-theory. Streamlining this perspective in terms of a reduction
procedure in the context of extra-dimensional approaches to symmetry theories is expected
to be extremely useful, especially when studying theories in low dimensions, for which the
engineering geometries become complicated. In such cases the distinctions between differ-
ent cohomology theories will likely be more prominent. This will be addressed in future
work [51].

Matching Bulk and Boundary Computations
In this appendix we give examples of bulk intersection computations for 1-form anomalies
of 5D SCFTs engineered by M-theory X = C3/ZN. These computation functions as checks
and are compared to the η-invariant computations with which they ultimately agree. We
have evaluated O(500) examples of the type C3/ZN via Mathematica, both with isolated
and non-isolated singularities, similar to the two representative examples below.
A.1
Isolated Singularity Example: C3/Z2n+1(1, 1, 2n −1)
General examples quickly become unwieldy and therefore we spell out details only for the
particularly favorable case of the 1-parameter family of orbifolds C3/Z2n+1(1, 1, 2n −1). We
will explicitly demonstrate that the bulk computation agrees with the boundary η-invariant
computation and give the computations producing the first row in table 1.
To proceed then, take Z to be the crepant resolution of C3/Z2n+1(1, 1, 2n−1). See figure
3 for the triangulated toric diagrams corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, 4. The bulk integral (5.6)
for α will now be evaluated using the intersection ring of Z which we therefore determine
first via standard methods from toric geometry.

Figure 3: Triangulated and refined toric diagrams for the orbifold C3/Z2n+1 with an action carrying
weights (1, 1, 2n −1).
We give the triangulated diagrams for the first four cases n = 1, 2, 3, 4
associated with the crepant resolution. The black dots indicate n compact toric divisors, located at
(x, y) = (0, 0), . . . , (0, n −1). The 3 brown dots indicate the non-compact divisors zi = 0 denoted
Dzi located at (−1, 0), (1, 2n −1), (0, −1) for i = 1, 2, 3 respectively.
To begin, note that under toric resolution of C3/Z2n+1 with respect to the (in this case
unique) triangulation depicted in figure 3, one has that the isolated codimension-6 singularity
is replaced by a collection of n complex surfaces:
F5
F7
F2n−1
F3
P2
h
b3
d3

d5
b7

b2n−1
(A.1)
Here Fn denotes the n-th Hirzebruch surface whose homology lattice of 2-cycles is generated
by the curves bn, fn with intersections bn · bn = −n and fn · fn = 0 and fn · bn = 1. Further,
we have introduced the combination dn = bn + nfn and denote the hyperplane class of P2 by
h with intersection h · h = 1.
The notation in (A.1) then indicates a gluing of surfaces over curves, following the no-
tation in [108, 109]. The compact divisors organizing into a linear chain, i.e., line (A.1), is
what makes this example particularly favorable.
The toric resolution is made explicit as follows: Starting from the fan with vertices
u1 = (−1, 0, 1) ,
u2 = (1, 2n −1, 1) ,
u3 = (0, −1, 1) ,
(A.2)
and the fully triangulated refined toric diagram in figure 3 we note that besides the compact
47


toric divisors P2, F3, . . . , F2n−1 there are also three non-compact toric divisors. In the unre-
solved geometry C3/Z2n+1 these are simply obtained by setting each coordinate zi to zero in
turn. We therefore denote these by Dzi indicated in the vanishing coordinate as a subscript.
Modulo 2n + 1 we have u1 + u2 + (2n −1)u3 = 0 and therefore the ui are in correspondence
with the Dzi.
To proceed, we denote the coordinates associated with the n compact exceptional toric
divisors by e0, e1, . . . , en−1 = 0 respectively. The divisors are De0, De1, . . . Den−1 respectively,
were Dek corresponds to the vector vk = (0, k, 1). Explicitly, De0 = P2 and Dek = F2k+1 for
k = 1, . . . , n −1. Overall, proceeding with standard techniques,47 these toric divisors are
found to be subject to the linear equivalences

(A.4)
With this we can compute all triple intersections between toric divisors from those of the
compact divisors which are
P2 · P2 · P2 = 9 ,
P2 · P2 · F3 = −3 ,
Fk+2 · Fk+2 · Fk = k ,
Fk · Fk · Fk = 8 ,
F3 · F3 · P2 = 1 ,
Fk−2 · Fk−2 · Fk = −k .
(A.5)
Given this intersection ring, we now compute the α for the family of 5D SCFTs engineered
by C3/Z2n+1(1, 1, 2n −1) in M-theory. With respect to the completely smooth Z the bulk
integral (5.6) is expressed as an intersection as
Dz3 · Dz3 · Dz3

−p1(Z) · Dz3
24
= n(n + 1)
6(2n + 1)
mod 1 .
(A.6)

where p1(Z) is given, following [113]:
p1(Z) =

i=1
Dzi · Dzi +
n−1
X
k=0
Dek · Dek .
(A.7)
The above expression disagrees with the first entry of table 1 (even after the shift n →n+1).
In general we can not expect that Dz3 is dual to the Kawasaki generator of Z2n+1 with respect
to which the first entry of table 1 was computed. To make this explicit we compute
Dz3 · Dz3 · Dz3 = n + 1
2n + 1
mod 1 ,
(A.8)
which we compare to the Kawasaki linking
ℓ(v2
2, v2) =
(2n −1)3
(2n −1)(2n + 1) =
4
2n + 1
mod 1 ,
(A.9)
and note that (A.8) and (A.9) differ by a factor of 8 = 23, i.e., s3 = 2 (see the paragraph
below (5.14) for a discussion of s3). We now normalize into the Kawasaki basis Dz3 →2Dz3
and compute
2Dz3 · 2Dz3 · 2Dz3
6
−p1(Z) · 2Dz3
24
= n(n −2)
3(2n + 1)
(A.10)
which agrees with the first entry in table 1 after the shift n →n + 1. Next, to determine the
remaining entries in the first row of table 1, we compute the charge, following (5.13), to
ℓ(v2, w4) = (2n −1)(2n −1)
(2n −1)(2n + 1) =
−2
2n + 1
mod 1 .
(A.11)
therefore q = −2. With this charge we have, by (5.9),

3(2n + 1)
(A.12)
with ω = exp(2πi/(2n + 1)) which is in perfect agreement with the bulk intersection com-
putations (A.10).
Next, we proceed to discuss the anomalies β, γ in greater detail, in particular their homo-
geneity properties. The goal will be to understand how for example redefinitions B2 →mB2
in the SymTFT action (5.2) are correctly captured by the anomalies given in (5.19) where,
given the expansion G4 = B2T2 + . . . , these ought to amount to βLQ, γLQ →βLmQ, γLmQ.
49


For this, we begin writing out the linear system resulting in (5.19), which is
Index( /D, L′
Q, Z) =
Z

2Q, Z) =

Z
ch(L′
2Q)ˆAZ −1
2η /D
L2Q(∂Z) .
(A.13)
Then, expanding the integral according to the two terms in (A.10), we have with respect to
Kawasaki’s generator
Index( /D, L′
q, Z) = βL′q + γL′q −1
2η /D
Lq(∂Z)
Index( /D, L′
2q, Z) = 8βL′q + 2γL′q −1
2η /D
L2q(∂Z) .
(A.14)
Let us denote the indices respectively by IL′q(Z), IL′
2q(Z) then we have
βL′q = + 1
12η /D
L2q(∂Z) −1

.
(A.15)
The point we make regarding (A.15) is that we have
βL′
2q = 8βL′q ,
γL′
2q = 2γL′q ,
βL2q ̸= 8βLq ,
γL2q ̸= 2γLq ,
(A.16)
with the second line as in (5.19). Note the primes and recall that L′
Q|∂Z = LQ. The first line
in (A.16) is obvious given the bulk expressions
βL′sq = 2sDz3 · 2sDz3 · 2sDz3
6

4ns3
3(2n + 1) ,
γL′sq = −p1(Z) · 2sDz3
24
= n(n + 2)s
3(2n + 1) .
(A.17)
The second line in (A.16) are boundary expressions. These compute, for example, to (match-
ing table 1 after the shift n →n + 1)
βLq = −2n −3
6(2n + 1) ,
γLq = 2n2 −2n −3
6(2n + 1)
,
(A.18)
and for βL2q, γL2q we find no closed form expressions (nonetheless they are straightforwardly
computable using (5.19)). Clearly, bulk and boundary computations differ. For the anoma-
50


lies given in (A.16) we compute the following differences
βLq −βL′q = 1

(A.20)
where we list out n = 1, . . . , 7. There are two conclusions to draw from these computations.
First, all differences in equations (A.19) and (A.20) are valued in Z6, and are equal and oppo-
site modulo 1. In this sense βLQ and γLQ have a single common Z6 ambiguity between them
(which is unphysical by (5.3)). Second, the boundary expressions (5.19) in general satisfy
the homogeneity relations βLmq = m3βLq and γLmq = mγLq only up to this Z6 ambiguity.
A.2
Non-Isolated Singularity Example: C3/Z2n+2(1, 1, 2n)
We now turn to the 1-parameter family of orbifolds C3/Z2n+2(1, 1, 2n). This class of example
is again particularly simple due to exceptional divisors organizing in a linear chain. We will
explicitly demonstrate that the bulk computation agrees with the boundary η-invariant
computation and verify the first entry in table 2.
This example has an su(2) ADE singularity supported on a plane C/Zn ⊂C3/Z2n+2 which
intersects the link S5/Z2n+2 in a circle S1/Zn+1. The bulk intersection will be computed with
respect to the fully resolved geometry. The comparison will however be with the η-invariant
associated to the singular model. These are found to agree, via the index theory we therefore
find that the η-invariant is invariant under resolutions induced by crepant resolutions of the
bulk as in (5.38).
To proceed then, we take Z to be the crepant resolution of C3/Z2n+2(1, 1, 2n). See figure
4 for the triangulated toric diagrams corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, 4. The bulk integral (5.6)
for α is evaluated using the intersection ring of Z which we therefore determine first via
methods of toric geometry.
Under crepant resolution of C3/Z2n+2 the isolated codimension-6 singularity is replaced
by a collection of n compact complex surfaces:

Here we are using the same conventions and techniques as were used for (A.1). Here h is
the compact curve of P1 × C which is one half of F0 = P1 × P1 in the sense that gluing two

Figure 4: Triangulated and refined toric diagrams for the orbifold C3/Z2n+2 with an action carrying
weights (1, 1, 2n). We give the triangulated diagrams for the first four cases n = 1, 2, 3, 4 associated
with the crepant resolution. The black dots indicate n compact toric divisors, located at (x, y) =
(0, 0), . . . , (0, n −1).
The 3 brown dots indicate the non-compact divisors zi = 0 denoted Dzi
located at (−1, 0), (1, 2n −1), (0, −1) for i = 1, 2, 3 respectively. The single blue dot indicates the
non-compact exceptional divisor at (0, n)
copies of P1 × C by identifying the two copies of C via z′ = 1/z gives P1.
This is made explicit in toric geometry. Starting from the fan with vertices
u1 = (−1, 0, 1) ,
u2 = (1, 2n, 1) ,
u3 = (0, −1, 1) ,
(A.22)
we can apply standard techniques to construct Z. See figure 4 for the fully triangulated
and refined toric diagram.
Besides the compact toric divisors F2, . . . , F2n there are also
four non-compact toric divisors. In the unresolved geometry C3/Z2n+2 three of these these
are simply obtained by setting each coordinate zi to zero in turn.
We therefore denote
these by Dzi indicated in the vanishing coordinate as a subscript. Modulo 2n + 2 we have
u1 + u2 + (2n)u3 = 0 and therefore the ui are in correspondence with the Dzi. The final non-
compact divisor is an exceptional toric divisor, topologically C × P1, which in the singular
model has the P1 contracted to an su(2) singularity.
We denote the coordinates associated with the n compact exceptional toric divisors by
e1, . . . , en = 0 respectively. The divisors are denoted respectively by De1, . . . Den. Here Dek
corresponds to the vector
vk = (0, k −1, 1) .
(A.23)
52


We also introduce the non-compact exceptional divisor Df with vertex vf = (0, n, 1). Ex-
plicitly, Df = C × P1 and Dek = F2k for k = 1, . . . , n. Overall, proceeding with standard
techniques, these toric divisors are found to be subject to three linear equivalences which
when solved for the 3 non-compact divisors Dzi expresses these as a rational linear combi-
nation of compact divisors

(A.24)
With this we can compute all triple intersections between toric divisors from those of the
exceptional divisors, which are
(P1 × C) · (P1 × C) · (P1 × C) = 1 ,
Fk · Fk · Fk = 8 ,
(A.25)
where we used P1 × C = F0/2, and
(P1 × C) · (P1 × C) · F2 = −2 ,
Fk+2 · Fk+2 · Fk = k ,
F2 · F2 · (P1 × C) = 0 ,
Fk−2 · Fk−2 · Fk = −k .
(A.26)
Next, we discuss the choice of divisor representing T2 in (5.6). We have
H2(S5/Z2n) = Zn ,
(A.27)
which is the subgroup Zn ⊂Z2n ∼= Γ. Considering coefficients modulo 1 (which realizes
the bulk to boundary screening) we see that Dz3 is a good non-compact divisor which on
the boundary corresponds to a generator of Zn. Then, given the above intersection ring,
we now compute the pure 1-form anomaly α of the 5D SCFTs engineered by M-theory
on C3/Z2n+2(1, 1, 2n). With respect to the completely smooth Z the bulk integral (5.6) is
expressed as an intersection as
Dz3 · Dz3 · Dz3
6
−p1(Z) · Dz3
24
= −n(n −1)
6(n + 1)
mod 1 .
(A.28)
The above expression disagrees with the first entry of table 2 by a sign. Therefore, −Dz3 is
dual to the Kawasaki generator, i.e., s3 = −1. Next, to determine the remaining entries in
53


the table, we compute the charge, following (5.13), to
ℓ(v2, w4) =
(2n)2
(2n)(2n + 2) =

n + 1 =

2n + 2

therefore q = −2. With this charge we have with (5.40)
